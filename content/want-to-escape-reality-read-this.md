Recently, I started reading again, and the very first book I picked up was the second book of _Days at the Morisaki Bookshop_, titled _More Days at the Morisaki Bookshop_. In just two days or so, I’m already halfway through, and I think I’ll be finishing it soon.


You know, the first book I read was a year ago, and the thoughts from that book still linger in my mind. Even now, I sometimes just sit and think about it — I don’t know why. The writing and the words are so incredibly simple that you can’t help but admire them. That simplicity makes it even more beautiful, you know? Just simple day-to-day life, simple words — no extreme drama — just the words and your everyday existence. You can even imagine that somewhere in the world, someone is living a life like that. And that makes it more relatable in a way.



If I had to describe the book in one line, I’d say it feels like a warm hug on a tough day — or like a warm embrace from a long-lost, good friend. I will definitely keep it in my library and recommend it to others.



A simple book, with simple words, a simple story — and an extraordinary experience.



**Read it yourself and get to know yourself.**  
I could definitely tell you about the story, but I think that would spoil it — the writer did a wonderful job.

**Happy reading, and let me know your thoughts!**
